Simple PayPal Shop

How to use:
1) Open index.html in a browser (for PayPal sandbox, use live web or http server). 
2) Replace YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID in the script src with your PayPal sandbox or live client id.
3) Add products using "Add / Edit Products". Products save in localStorage.

Notes:
- This is a frontend-only demo using PayPal JS SDK. For production, implement server-side order verification and capture as per PayPal best practices.
- Currency is INR (change in script src if needed).
